contract RockPaperScissors {
  /*
    Brief introduction:
    the game is about to submit your pick (R/P/S) with fee to the blockchain,
    join players into pairs and withdraw 2x the fee, or just 1x the fee in case of draw.
    if there will be no other player in &quot;LimitOfMinutes&quot; minutes you can refund your fee.

    The whole thing is made by picking a random value called SECRET_RAND, where (SECRET_RAND % 3) gives 0,1 or 2 for Rock,Paper or Scissors,
    then taking a hash of SECRET_RAND and submitting it as your ticket.
    At this moment player waits for opponent. If there is no opponent in &quot;LimitOfMinutes&quot;, player can refund or wait more.
    When both players sended their hashes then they have &quot;LimitOfMinutes&quot; minutes to announce their SECRET_RAND.
    As soon as both players provided their SECRET_RAND the withdraw is possible.
    If opponent will not announce his SECRET_RAND in LimitOfMinutes then the players bet is treated as a winning one.
    In any case (win, draw, refund) you should use Withdraw() function to pay out.

    There is fee of 1% for contract owner, charged while player withdraws.
    There is no fee for contract owner in case of refund.
